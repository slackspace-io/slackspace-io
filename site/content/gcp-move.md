I've rented a physical server running linux for nearly 15 years. Complete utter overkill for hosting this website. 

Over the years this has been my sandbox to try new technologies and techniques. Short list of nonsense i've played with

* Dogecoin mining pool circa 2014 (Maybe I should of kept that one going..)
* Full ELK stack + Grafana
* Various home automation rest APIs
* Varnish, nginx, apache, mysql, DNS, dovecot, squirrelmail, wordpress, etc
* Countless bash scripts doing god knows what
* Ansible tower, salt, puppet
* Various Distros - Fedora, Centos, Arch, Ubuntu

Basically it became my playground. Whether something I was considering for work, or just thought was interesting.

But these days, everyone is talking about public cloud. As an old linux geek i've got plenty of opinions from the side -- it's all still a server at the end of the day, right? At work I'm responsible for the teams working with public cloud but I don't have the luxury to be as hands on as I used to be.
