I saw this [reddit post][]. I've wanted to try to do some type of
project with my Raspberry Pi, and the idea of tech+home/stuff has always
intrigued me.

The current plan is a standing desk, or perhaps a coffee table.. but for
now, I've ordered the following bits to let me work on the tech bit. If
I master control of the LEDs, i'll figure out something to put it in.

Parts so far(Already had a Pi/SD Card, just never used it):  
[LED Lights][]  
[USB WiFi][]  
[Case][]  
[Wires][]  
[More Wires][]

I think these bits should let me get the wires going. Still deciding on
a power supply solution long-term, but I have things I can use interim
for testing.

Code wise, The current plan is run Arch-ARM(Already installed) with
python to control the LEDs, and tie into my onConnect project for
changing the lights depending on state changes monitored by onConnect.

Should be fun:D
