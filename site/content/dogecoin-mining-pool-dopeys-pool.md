Mining is a bit more on the geeky side, and is not something the average
person needs to do to obtain or spend dogecoin. If you're interested in
mining I suggest checking out the [dogemining subreddit][].

The general use of crypto currencies is something many of us expect to
be mainstream some day. It's growing in popularity and if you haven't
heard about it yet, you likely will soon.

Think of it is an internet currency that allows you to quickly and
easily send and receive money(dogecoin) online. More and more companies
are accepting it as a form of payment, and startup companies are
appearing to fill this new niche. It's going to be pretty neat seeing it
all unfold.
